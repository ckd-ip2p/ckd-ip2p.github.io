    <h1>IP2P results</h1>
    <p> Even if the sensitive attribute is not only gender but also age and skin color,
      a generative model such as ip2p can produce a counterfactual image well.
      In particular, we found that even sensitive attributes with three or more values, such as age,
      can easily generate counterfactual samples.</p>
