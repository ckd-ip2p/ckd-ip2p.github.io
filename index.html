    <h1>Additional IP2P examples</h1>
    <p> Counterfactual samples generated by IP2P. Sensitive attributes are age and skin color.
      Even if the sensitive attribute is not only gender but also age and skin color,
      a generative model such as ip2p can produce a counterfactual image well.
      In particular, we found that IP2P can easily generate counterfactual samples even for sensitive attributes with more than three values, such as age.</p>
