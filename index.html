    <h1>Additional IP2P examples</h1>
    <div> Counterfactual samples generated by IP2P. Sensitive attributes are age and skin color.
      Even when the sensitive attribute is not only gender but also age and skin color,
      a generative model like IP2P can produce counterfactual images well.
      In particular, we found that IP2P can easily generate counterfactual samples even for sensitive attributes with more than three values, such as age.</div>
